1) 	The install event fires when a ServiceWorker is first fetched. This is your chance to 
	prime the ServiceWorker cache with the fundamental resources that should be available

2)  The fetch event fires whenever a request originates from your ServiceWorker scope, and 
	youâ€™ll get a chance to intercept the request and respond immediately, without going to the network.

3)  The activate event fires after a successful installation. You can use it to phase out older
